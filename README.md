#This Figma Challenge project shows the reproduction of a high-fidelity Figma design found on the Frontend Mentor challenges page of the Frontend Mentors website, using Bootstrap.
##The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, with Bootstrap.
###Some challenges faced while building this project include integrating Bootstrap components. If I had more time I would get more mastery in the use of Bootstrap before completing this project. 
####The original Figma screenshot is in the Assets folder.
